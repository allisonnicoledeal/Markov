Thank you very much sir! You are a gentleman and a scholar. …Oh. I’m sorry. Okay. I’m sorry. My mistake. …That was a woman I was talking to. She has a very low voice. Probably a smoker. 

The Extreme Home Makeover show can come in and re-do a house in one hour. If you guys were on their crew, you would be fired like that!

 Wet cement, outside, it’s drying, fast, come on! This is a life long dream. What do I write? Kevin: Michael you could put your initials in it.  MGS? No. Some idiot named Mark Greg Splutnick will claim credit for it.

A boss’s salary isn’t just about money. It is about perks. It- for example, every year I get a one hundred dollar gas card. Can’t put a price tag on that.

 Watch out, Pam. You’re Next. Pam Beesly: You’re going to throw my things on the ground?  Maybe

Wikipedia. Is the best thing ever. Anyone, in the world, can write anything they want about any subject. So you know you are getting the best possible information.

When I needed salespeople for my new paper company, everyone here turned their back on me. Am I going to ask them to beg for forgiveness, no. Am I going to ask for a big, crying, apology? No. Am I going to ask them to slit their wrists for me? [smiling] No! I just want a tiny microscopic version of that.

Hi. Sorry. Crazy day. You’ve seen how the sausage gets made, come in the conference room and I will show you a finished sausage.

We can’t just sit around waiting for Creed to die.

Hey it's 12:20. Where the hell's Dwight?
Jim Halpert:  Ummm... no idea.
  "Never missed a day", my ass.
  Alright here we go. This is gonna be fun. Ready? Alright, first name is Tom.
Jan:  No, no, no! No names! No rhyming! No sounds a-likes, you actually have to--
  Ok! Ok! You're getting into my head! First name is blank and he goes on a cruise. He goes on a Caribbean cruiseee.
Angela:   I don't know.
Jim Halpert:  Katie Holmes.
  Bahhhhhh!! But he's married to her!
Jim Halpert:  Oh Dawson's Creek.
  No! No, it has to be a real person, Jim, come on! Ok no no I'm gonna pass. Ahh, oh ok! Um, rhymes with Parnold Sporchzenegger.
Jan:  No rhyming!
Jim Halpert:  No really a rhyme...
Angela:   Another clue! Another clue!
  Alright he's the Governor of California, he is The Terminator...
Angela:   Those aren't helpful--
Jim Halpert:  Tom Cruise!
  Noo--
Andy:   Time!
  Does anyone read the paper??
Jo Bennett:   It's a little form. Says, "I did not do it."
  There is no reason for anyone here to sign this because I know everything there is to know about these people. I know when their birthdays are, I know what their favorite kind of cake is, I know what color streamers they like.
Jo Bennett:   All that's just birthday information.
  Yes, yes, but it shows a bigger picture.
  You've been X Punk'd! We were kidding! And, Ryan, Ryan, he was in on it...
Pam Beasley:  You're a jerk!
  Well, I don't know about that...
  Tell me Dana, how is your chicken breast?
Waitress:   Oh, it's great. It's served with our world famous wing sauce.
  Mmmm, sounds yummy. I will have a chicken breast, hold the chicken.
Waitress:   Is that what you really want?
  No, I'm gonna have the gourmet hotdog.
Waitress:   Great.
Dwight Schrute:   Michael, what's wrong?
  Everything is wrong, Dwight. The stress of my modern office has made me depressed.
Dwight Schrute:   Depressed? Isn't that just a fancy word for feeling, 'bummed down?'
  Dwight, you ignorant slut!
  Love that Andy. Right? Solid fellow. Seems smart enough. Likes me a lot. A lot. Too much. Like a crazy person a lil. Not super crazy just... just something about him that creeps me out. I can't really explain it. He's always up in my business. Which is ebonics for being in my face and annoying the bejesus out of me. I don't understand how someone could have so little self awareness.
  I don't understand. You want to see other people? Only other people.
  It's not been a blockbuster year for me financially. My Blockbuster stock is down.
  Leader. Ship. The word 'ship' is hidden in side the word 'leadership,' as its... derivation.
  So, I need a little treat for the gang. Something to win their affections back.
Ryan:   Back? Why is that, Michael?
  Well, I ran down Meredith in my car.
Ryan:   Ohhhh. Did you do this on purpose?
  No. I was being negligent.  
  There's such a thing as good grief. Just ask Charlie Brown.


  So older people have just as many rights as younger people.
Jan:  Yes, Michael.

Darryl:   Mike you know you don't need to turn us all in. All you need is one scapegoat.
Kelly:  Uh, if you turn me in I'm turning in Darryl.
  That's just what we need. Another black man in prison.

  Alright... Oh! [pulls out his mic from his shirt] This is gonna feel so good, getting this thing off my chest. [he hands them the body mic, when he speaks it is inaudible now] That's what she said! [waves goodbye and walks off to his gate, halfway there Pam comes running up to him and they hug for a while. They say their goodbyes to each other, and Michael walks off for good]

  Um actually I'm sending Ryan on a top secret mission. Tell her what it is.
Ryan:   Updating emergency contacts?
Pam Beesly:   Well, is that really a priority?
  Is it a priority? Oh I dunno. Um, what if there's a tornado, Pam? Peoples legs are crushed under rubble. 'Please, would you be so kind as to call my wife?' No, I can't, because we don't have any emergency contact information because Pam said it wasn't a priority. Think, think with your head Pam.

Jan's lawyer:   How long have you known the plantiff?
  I haven't actually seen it. But I have seen The Firm and I am planning on renting The Pelican Brief.

Oscar:  The long term problem is bad investments, that they need to dump. The short term problem is the company has no cash and there's no where to get it.
  Okay, Oscar. I don't need the whole enchilada just the bullet points.

  The most sacred thing I do is care... Today I am in charge of picking a great new healthcare plan. Right? That's what this is all about. Does that make me their doctor? Um, yes. Like a specialist.

Jan:  So where's this train taking us?
  I think the engineer left.

  You know what Dwight? You''re acting like a dork.

  How did you get this number?
Todd Packer:  From your mom, you gay nerd!

  I would like to introduce you to a man who needs no introduction, probably because most of you have DONE IT WITH HIM. Just kidding. He wouldn't be interested in any of you.
Kevin:  Michael, the baby's already been born.
  Yeah, duhh.
Kevin:  Yea, so, we had games planned, but the baby ruins all of 'em.
  No, the baby doesn't ruin anything, Kevin. Okay? The baby multiplies the fun. So let's just do what you were going to do.
Kevin:  Okay... Who wants to guess when the baby will be born.

[over speakerphone] I don't understand. Is anyone hurt?
 Not on the surface, no. But I can tell people are disturbed, David.
David Wallace:  [upset] Michael! You texted me. 911. Call me. All in caps. Do you know what 911 means?
 Never missed a day, my ass.
 How long have you known about the pregnancy? A week? A month? A year?
Jim Halpert:  Michael we only told our parents last week.
 Did you pee on a stick?
Jim Halpert:  I did. It was inconclusive.
 You should've told me.
Pam Beesly:   You're right. We should have realize that you are an equal part in this.
 I was eventually going to get around to my dream, obviously. Eleven years that I could have been working on "The Scarn Nebulous".
 I have a special assignment for you.
Dwight Schrute:   Who's the target?
 A sensitive email has been released to the office. It contains a file. A picture. Filename is Jamaica Jan Sun Princess.
Dwight Schrute:   What's it of?
 Not important.
Dwight Schrute:   Unless you're willing to tell me everything I cannot accept this assignment.
 Forget it-
Dwight Schrute:   Ok, I accept it.
 Why are you playing the national anthem?
Jim Halpert:  Um, 'cause your condo is in America.
 Oh.
  [origami cranes move on a line behind them]
 What the hell is that?
Jim Halpert:  Those are the doves.
 Olympics of suffering right here! Slavery versus the Holocaust, c'mon!
Darryl:   Mike you know you don't need to turn us all in. All you need is one scapegoat.
Kelly:  Uh, if you turn me in I'm turning in Darryl.
 That's just what we need. Another black man in prison.
  [a news crew approaches Michael outside of the branch]
Reporter:   Michael Scott!
 Yes.
Reporter:   Do you want to make a comment on the rumors?
 [sighs] Um. I have done some very bad things. Things of which I am not proud. I would like to publicly apologize to, the coach and the players. And, I vow to never listen to my bodily instincts ever again.
Reporter:   I'm talking about the Sabre printers that catch on fire.
 Oh! OK. I was talking about... what, what's going on?
 If you guys insist on having your own private little love fest--
Jim Halpert:  We do.
 --that none of us can be a part of--
Pam Beesly:   You can't be apart of our relationship, Michael.
 --THEN, we are going to have our own private Valentine's day party.
Jim Halpert:  That sounds fun.
 So suck it.
 [both beat-boxing in the warehouse] Im MJ Mike Scott and I am hot. She's DJ Chazzy Flax and she is the best. All those other suckers can suck our fat!
Holly:  Wica-wica-wica-wica what?! 
 You want to eat cat food with Kevin and not go to the hospital?

  Hey, uh, can I help you out in here?
Mr. Brown: Oh, I'm all set, thanks.
Gotcha. Good. I'd go with the rows. That's a good idea.
 
Today is diversity day and someone's going to come in and talk to us about diversity. It's something that I've been pushing, that I've been wanting to push, for a long time and Corporate mandated it. And I never actually talked to Corporate about it. They kind of beat me to the punch, the bastards. But I was going to. And I think it's very important that we have this. I'm very, very excited.
 
Jim: That's the thing. It's very sturdy paper and on the back it says, "100% post-consumer content." What? Hello? Uh-huh. Wait. What? I'm sorry, Mr. Decker. I think I'm losing you. [Shedder whirring] Hello? Hello? Yeah. Hold on one second. I don't know. Hold on one second.
Jim: Do you really have to do that right now?
Dwight: Yes I do. I should have done it weeks ago actually.
Jim: Mr. Decker, I'm sorry about that. What were you... Can you hold on one second? Yeah, just one second. Thanks. [Power off, silence] Hello? That's it. Perfect. So what I was saying... [Dialing tone] Hello? Thanks, Dwight.
Dwight: Retaliation. Tit for tit.
Jim: That is not the expression.
Dwight: Well, it should be.
 
Jim: This is my biggest sale of the year. They love me over there for some reason. I'm not really sure why but I make one call over there every year, just to renew their account, and that one call ends up being 25% of my commission for the whole year, so I buy a mini bottle of champagne, celebrate a little. And this year I'm pushing recycled paper on them for one percent more. I know. I'm getting cocky. Right?
 
Jim: Solitaire?
Pam: Yeah, Freecell.
Jim: Six on seven.
Pam: I know. I saw that.
Jim: So then, why didn't you do it?
Pam: I'm saving that 'cause I like it when the cards go T-ts-ts-tch-tch-tch.
Jim: Who doesn't love that?
 
Hey, Oscar! How are you doing, man?
Oscar: All right.
Did you have a good weekend going there?
Oscar: It was fine.
Oh yeah, I bet it was fun. [to Mr. Brown] Oh, hey! This is Oscar---
Oscar: Martinez.
Right. See? I don't even know, first-name basis!
Mr. Brown: Great. We're all set.
Oh hey, well, diversity, everybody, let's do it. Oscar works in... here. Jim, could you wrap it up, please?
Jim: Yeah, uh, Mr. Decker, please.
It's diversity day, Jim. I wish every day was diversity day.
Jim: You know what? I'm actually going to have to call you back. Thank you. Sorry about that.
 
Mr. Brown: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Great.
Come on people, let's get 'em in. Get in the cards! Get in the cards!
Mr. Brown: Thank you. Thank you very much. OK. Thanks for filling these out and I promise this'll be quick. At Diversity Today, our philosophy is about honesty and positive expectations. We believe that 99% of the problems in the workplace arise simply out of ignorance.
You know what? This is a color-free-zone here. Stanley, I don't look at you as another race.
Mr. Brown: Uh, see this is what I'm talking about. We don't have to pretend we're color-blind.
Exactly, were not...
Mr. Brown: That's fighting ignorance with more ignorance.
With tolerance.
Mr. Brown: No. With more ignorance.
Ignorance.
Mr. Brown: Right. Exactly. Uh, instead, we need to celebrate our diversity.
Let's celebrate.
Mr. Brown: Right. OK.
Celebrate good times. Come on! Let's celebrate diversity. Right?
Mr. Brown: Yes, exactly. Now here's what we're going to do. I've noticed that...
You know what? Here's what we're going to do. Why don't we go around and everybody... everybody say a race that you are attracted to sexually. I will go last. Go.
Dwight: I have two. White and Indian.
Mr. Brown: Actually, I'd prefer not to start that way. Michael, I would love to have your permission to run this session. Can I have your permission?
Yes.
Mr. Brown: Thank you very much. And it would also help me if you were seated.
OK.
Mr. Brown: Thank you. OK. Now, at the start of the session, I had you all write down an incident that you found offensive in the workplace. Now, what I'm going to do is choose one and we're going to act it out.
Dwight: A few of the ground rules?
Hey, hey why don't you run it by me and I'll run it by him.
Dwight: OK, can we steer away from gay people?
Mr. Brown: Um...
Dwight: I'm sorry. It's an orientation. It's not a race. Plus a lot of other races are intolerant of gays, so...paradox.
Mr. Brown: Well, we only have an hour.
Dwight: I figured it would save time.
OK. Why don't we just defer to Mr...
Mr. Brown: Mr. Brown.
Ah. Oh, right! OK. First test. I will not call you that.
Mr. Brown: Well, it's my name. It's not a test. OK? Um, so looking through the cards, I've noticed that many of you wrote down the same incident, which is ironic, because it's the exact incident I was brought in here to respond to. Now, how many of you are familiar with the Chris Rock routine? Very good. OK.
 
How come Chris Rock can do a routine and everybody finds it hilarious and ground-breaking and then I go and do the exact same routine, same comedic timing, and people file a complaint to Corporate? Is it because I'm white and Chris is black?
 
Mr. Brown: So we're going to reenact this with a more positive outcome.
I will play the Chris Rock guy. I would like to see someone else pull this off.
Mr. Brown: Well, let's have someone who wasn't involved in the reenactment.
OK, I will play guy listening.
Mr. Brown: Great. Guy listening. Ok, anyone else remember?
Kevin: I remember.
Mr. Brown: Great. You're the Chris Rock guy and you're guy listening.
OK.
 
Kevin is a great guy. He's a great accountant. He is not much of an entertainer.
 
Kevin: Basically, there are two types of black people and black people are actually more racist because they hate the other type of black people. Every time the one type wants to have a good time, then the other type comes in and makes a real mess.
OK. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. He's ruin... He's butchering it. Could you just let me... [As Chris Rock] Every time... Every time black people want to have a good time, some ignant ass... [Bleep] I take care of my kid!
Mr. Brown: Wait a second.
[Bleep] They always want credit for something they supPOSED to do!
Mr. Brown: Stop it!
[As Chris Rock] What you want a cookie?
 
Mr. Brown: Now, this is a simple acronym. HERO. Uh, at Diversity Today, we believe it is very easy to be a HERO. All you need are honesty, empathy, respect and open-mindedness.
Dwight: Excuse me, I'm sorry, but that's not all it takes to be a hero.
Mr. Brown: Oh, great. Well, what is a hero to you?
Dwight: A hero kills people, people that wish him harm.
Mr. Brown: OK.
Dwight: A hero is part-human and part-supernatural. A hero is born out of a childhood trauma, or out of a disaster that must be avenged.
Mr. Brown: Ok, you're thinking of a superhero.
Dwight: We all have a hero in our heart.
Mr. Brown: Now, I need you to take these forms. This kind of expresses the joint experience we had today. And I need you to look 'em over and sign them as kind of a group pledge.
[Clears throat] I don't think I can sign this.
Mr. Brown: I can't leave until you do.
Well, OK, it says here that I learned something and I knew all this stuff already, so... I know, I could sign something that says that I taught something, or that I helped you teach something, so... Pam! Where is she? Pam, could we change something on this?
Mr. Brown: Michael, can I talk to you candidly?
Sure.
 
Mr. Brown: We both know that I'm here because of the comments you made.
Here's the thing. This office, I think this is very advanced in terms of... racial awareness and it's probably more advanced than you're used to. That's probably throwing you off a little bit.
Mr. Brown: Um, it's not throwing me. I need your signature.
OK, well I know. You told me that several times.
Mr. Brown: Yes, but you're not listening to me. Yours is the only signature I need.
OK.
Mr. Brown: Those are my instructions from the Corporate offices to put you through this seminar for the comments that you made. The reason I made copies for everyone was so you wouldn't be embarrassed.
Well, here I am thinking that you actually cared about diversity training. And you don't.
Mr. Brown: Don't worry about dating.
I won't.
Mr. Brown: OK. Thank you.
Yeah, yeah.
 
"I regret my actions. I regret offending my coworkers. I pledge to bring my best spirit of honesty, empathy, respect and open-mindedness..." Open-mindedness, is that even a word? "...into the workplace. In this way, I can truly be a hero. Signed, Daffy Duck." [Laughing] He's going to lose it when he reads that.
 
Jim: Yeah, hi. Is Mr. Decker around? Oh, well, could you just have him call me after lunch? Thank you.
"I pledge to always keep an open mind and an open heart." I do believe... in that part of the pledge I that just read. But a pledge? Come on. I mean who are we, the Girl Scouts? No. Look... the guy, "Mr. Brown," he got us halfway there. He got us talking. Well, no. I got us talking. He got us nothing. He insulted us and he abandoned us. You call that diversity training? I don't. Were there any connections between any of us? Did anyone look each other in the eye? Was there any emotion going on? No. Where was the heart? I didn't see any heart. Where was my Oprah moment? OK, get as much done as you can before lunch because, afterward, I'm going to have you all in tears.
 
All right? Everybody pretty? Come on. Here we go. It's time. Let's do some good.
Toby: Hey, we're not all going to sit in a circle Indian style are we? [Laughing]
Get out.
Toby: I'm sorry.
No, this is not a joke. OK? That was offensive and lame. So double offensive. This is an environment of welcoming and you should just get the hell out of here. OK, let's go. Let's do it. Come on. Let's have some fun, everybody. Here we go. Take a seat. Cop a squat. And um... thanks for coming in. Um... Diversity... is the cornerstone of progress as I've always said. But don't take my word for it. Let's take a look at the tape.
 
[on the tape] Hi. I'm Michael Scott. I'm in charge of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products here in Scranton, Pennsylvania but I'm also the founder of Diversity Tomorrow, because today is almost over. Abraham Lincoln once said that, "If you're a racist, I will attack you with the North." And those are the principles that I carry with me in the workplace.
 
OK. Questions? Comments? Anybody? Jim?
Jim: : Uh, is that it?
Yes. I only had an hour to put it together but I'm going to add on to it later on.
Kevin: It was kind of hard to hear.
Uh, yes. That probably had something to do with the camera work. Anybody else? Um...
Kelly: I have a customer meeting.
Yeah, well, if you leave we'll only have two left. Yes. Enjoy. Absolutely. Namaste. Ok, well since I am leading this, let's get down to business and why don't I just kind of introduce myself, OK? Um. I am Michael and I am part English, Irish, German and Scottish. Sort of a virtual United Nations. But what some of you might not know is that I am also part Native American Indian.
Oscar: What part Native American?
Two fifteenths.
Oscar: Two fifteenths, that fraction doesn't make any sense.
Well, you know what, it's kind of hard for me to talk about it. Their suffering. So who else? Let's get this popping. Come on. Who's going? Who's going? Let's go here. Oscar, right here. You're on.
Oscar: OK, Michael, um... Both my parents were born in Mexico.
Oh, yeah...
Oscar: And, uh, they moved to the United Sates a year before I was born. So I grew up in the United States.
Wow.
Oscar: My parents were Mexican.
Wow. That is... That is a great story. That's the American Dream right there, right?
Oscar: Thank... Yeah...
Um, let me ask you, is there a term besides Mexican that you prefer? Something less offensive?
Oscar: Mexican isn't offensive.
Well, it has certain connotations.
Oscar: Like what?
Like... I don't... I don't know.
Oscar: What connotations, Michael? You meant something.
No. Now, remember that honesty...
Oscar: I'm just curious.
...empathy, respect... [Phone ringing] Jim! Jim!
Jim: Hello? Hello?
 
I have something here. I want you to take a card. Put it on your fore... Don't look at the card. I want you to take the card and put it on your forehead and... Take a card, take a card, any card. Um... And I want you to treat other people like the race that is on their forehead. OK? So everybody has a different race. Nobody knows what their race is, so... I want you to really go for it, cause this is real. You know, this isn't just an exercise. This is real life. And... I have a dream that you will really let the sparks fly. Get 'er done.
 
Why? Because Martin Luther King is a hero of mine. There's this great Chris Rock bit about how streets named after Martin Luther King tend to be more violent. I'm not going to do it but it's...
 
Oh this is a good one.
Pam: Um, hi. How are you?
Stanley: Fine. How are you?
Pam: Great.
Push it.
Stanley: I admire your culture's success in America.
Pam: Thank you.
Good. Bom bom bom-bom bom. Come on Olympics of Suffering right here. Slavery versus the Holocaust. Come on.
Stanley: Who am I supposed to be?
No, that was inadvertent. We didn't actually plan that.
Dwight: Lots of cultures eat rice, doesn't help me.
Dwight: Um... Shalom. I'd like to apply for a loan.
Pam: That's nice, Dwight.
Dwight: OK, do me. Something stereotypical so I can get it really quick.
Pam: OK, I like your food.
Dwight: Outback steakhouse. [Australian accent] I'm Australian, mate!
Pam, come on. "I like your food." Come on stir the pot. Stir the melting pot, Pam! Let's do it. Let's get ugly. Let's get real.
Pam: OK. If I have to do this, based on stereotypes that are totally untrue, that I do not agree with, you would maybe not be a very good driver.
Dwight: Oh, man, am I a woman?
 
You'll notice I didn't have anybody be an Arab. I thought that would be too explosive. No pun intended. But I just though. "Too soon for Arabs." Maybe next year. Um... You know, the ball's in their court.
 
Jim: What are you watching?
Ryan: Chappelle's Show.
Jim: Really?
Ryan: I downloaded it on her computer. I hope she doesn't mind. She just had a lot of extra space.
Jim: No way. I think she likes this stuff.
Ryan: Great. She's cute, huh?
Jim: Yeah, you know, she's engaged, but...
Ryan: Oh, no, the girl in the... sketch.
Jim: Oh, yeah. She's hot.
 
Kevin: Hey.
Angela: Hey.
Kevin: You wanna go to the beach?
Angela: Sure.
Kevin: You wanna get high?
Angela: No.
Kevin: I think you do, mon.
Angela: Stop...
OK. All right. No. It's good. You just need to push it. You need to go a little bit further. All right. OK.
 
[Voice raised, Indian accent] Kelly, how are you?
Kelly: I just had the longest meeting.
Oh! Welcome to my convenience store. Would you like some googi googi? I have some very delicious googi, googi, only 99 cents plus tax. Try my googi, googi. [Lowering voice] Try my googi, googi. [High-pitched voice] Try my googi, googi. Try my... [slap!]
[trying not to cry] All right! All right! Yes! That was great, she gets it! Now she knows what it's like to be a minority.
 
Jim: [on the phone] Mr. Decker, we didn't lose your sale today, did we? Excellent. OK. Let me just get your... what's that? No, we didn't close last time. I just need your... Oh. W-What code were you given? Oh, OK. That's actually another salesman here. I can redo it if you want to do that. Oh, he gave you a discount? No, I don't blame you.
 
I just hated it when that guy was in here. Mr. Brown, if that was his real name. I mean, he had never met any of us before, and here he was telling us how to do our thing. I just wanted... I just wanted to do it our way. You know? On our own. Man I should have gotten some food.
Kevin: [Itialian accent]Maybe some spagh-etti.
Okay, Kevin. You can take that off that thing, OK? That would really, really have shown him up, wouldn't it? If I'd brought in some burritos or some colored greens. Or some pad Thai. I love pad Thai.
Stanley: It's collard greens.
What?
Stanley: It's collard greens.
That doesn't really make sense. Because you don't call them collared people, that's offensive. Hmmm... OK, well, it's after five. So... Thank you very much. Buena vista Oscar. Thank you. Good job. Oh, my man. Thank you Brazil. Nice.
 
Jim: [Pam is asleep, resting her head on Jim's shoulder] Um... Hey.
Pam: [stirs] Mmmm.
Jim: Hey.
Pam: Oh.
Jim: We can go.
Pam: Sorry.
Jim: That's fine.
 
Jim: Uh... Not a bad day.
 
 
 
Mr. Brown: Thanks for filling these out. I promise this will be quick. We only have about an hour.
Yeah. I would like to see us erase 100 years of racism in an hour.
Mr. Brown: Does this company have 100 years to erase?
No, the country.
Mr. Brown: Oh right, more like 200 years.
Yeah, more like a 1,000.
Mr. Brown: Okay, um. Uh, I'll try to make this quick.
 
 
Dwight: I am a salesman, okay. And I don't think we should be doing this during prime sales hours. If you can prove to me that diversity is going to help my sales, I'll go elephant running with James Earl Jones. I really will, but not on spec.
 
 
Mr. Brown: HERO, at Diversity Today, we believe it is very easy to be a HERO. All you need are honesty, empathy, respect and open-mindedness.
I just think that HERO? It's cute, but it's... It's empty, you know? It's easy. Dwight, you know what, I came up with some terms of my own. Could you put these on the board? The first one is Inclusion, New Attitudes, Color-blind...
Mr. Brown: Oh, nice.
Expectations....
Mr. Brown: Good.
Thank you. Sharing...
Mr. Brown: Great.
And tolerance.
Mr. Brown: Beautiful.
Pam: Um, that spells incest.
Mr. Brown: Oh, my sorry. That is not appropriate.
Well, it's not ideal but you have to give me some credit 'cause I made it into a word.
Mr. Brown: Yeah, but it's not appropriate. This is not helpful as a memory aid.
I will give you a number of reasons why it is, actually. Okay, first, incest is bad. Racism is bad. No brainer, right? Two, incest. We're all a family, right? We're all brothers and sisters. Racial message? Um? Number three, and this is a fact. The states where they have a lot of racism are the states where they have a lot of incest. Okay? And finally...
Mr. Brown: Okay, Michael, I just...
No, no, no, no, wait. Final one, final one this is important. The more we can encourage interracial dating as a society the further away we get from incest, literally.
 
Pam: It would've been just as easy for him to spell insect. Of course, that wouldn't have made any sense either.
 
 
Mr. Brown: Does anyone have anything else at all? Anyone besides Michael?
Ryan: I have something.
Mr. Brown: Yes, please.
Ryan: Um, well I grew up here in Scranton and when I was a kid the guy who lived next door was a former baseball player, who actually played pro ball before the leagues were integrated. And he had the most incredible stories about...
Okay. I'm sorry, I'm sorry this guy's a temp and I should've told you that.
Mr. Brown: No, no, no, no. An outsider's perspective would probably be pretty helpful.
Yeah, but no, seriously. Uh, you know, he's not a member of the full staff so, uh, Ryan you wanna just step outside?
Ryan: What do you want me to do?
Well, maybe you should go down to the parking lot. You know what. Yes, go down to the parking lot and check to se if any of our guests have parked in the handicapped spots. Cool? 'Cause the handicaps get a raw deal. Oh, you know what. That ties right into New Attitudes. New attitudes about handicap people. Very important.
Mr. Brown: I'm sorry, Michael. We're actually out of time.
 
Pam: Yeah, um, there's good things about Michael. He uh, uh... Yeah, definitely. Um...
 
 
"In this way, I can truly be a hero. Signed, Daffy Duck." [laughing] He's going to lose it when he reads that. Doh! Hogan! Not again, Hogan! Get Col. Burkhalter on the phone! [laughing] I'm kind of a Hogan around here. And kind of, Jan is kind of Col. Burkhalter, then Dwight is Schultz. But, it's... Oh, God. We have fun. We have fun. 'Cause he's gonna be pissed. [making voice] No doubt about it.
 
 
Dwight: What you doing?
Jim: Freecell.
Dwight: Solitaire is a one-player game. It can't have two players.
Jim: Well, I mean.
Dwight: What's your win rate?
Pam: Seventy-six percent. What's yours?
Dwight: You're not allowed to play two-player. You need to start over.
Pam: You're doing fine.
 
 
Are we going? [Dwight puts four fingers in front of the camera to start a countdown] Don't do that. Just say action when we're ready.
Dwight: Dunder Mifflin, Michael Scott, Diversity Tomorrow, take four. And action.
[mumbling] Should I... turn, no. Do it again.
Dwight: Diversity Tomorrow, take five. Action.
Hi. I'm Michael Scott. I'm in charge of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products here in Scranton, Pennsylvania but I'm also the founder of Diversity Tomorrow, because today is almost over. Abraham Lincoln once said that, "If you're a racist, I will attack you with the North." And those are the principles... Damn it. Okay, sorry. Don't laugh; please don't laugh this time Dwight. You're... it's, it's bugging me. Let me give myself a countdown, ready? Three, two, one.
Dwight: Take six.
Just let me do it! God! Three, two, one. Hi. I'm Michael Scott. I'm in charge of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products here in Scranton... Keep the camera steady please! People are gonna get sea sick watching this. Ready? Three, two, one.
Dwight: Action.
Don't. Please don't say anything. [sighs] Oh, God.
Dwight: And action... Lights, camera, action. Whenever you're ready.
Could I count myself down please, Dwight. Three, two, one. Hi. I'm Michael Scott. I'm in charge of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products here in Scranton, Pennsylvania but I'm also the founder of Diversity Tomorrow, because today is almost over. Abraham Lincoln once said that, "If you're a racist, I will attack you with the North." And those are the principles that I carry with me in the workplace.
Dwight: Cut.
 
 
[wandering around the room during his diversity exercise] I want you to push it. I want you to push 'cause breakthroughs are right around the corner. Something's going to pop here. Something's going to pop between a party. Feel what it's like to be in someone else's skin. What does it feel like to be a different race? It feels pretty bad doesn't it. So let that come out.
 
 
Yeah, I marched on Washington back in the day. I went to the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial, U.S. Mint, congressman talked to our class. It was pretty cool.
 
Talk like you're talking to that race. I have a feeling that this could get kind of volatile. So keep it going. [camera shows Devon sitting outside with West Nile]
 
 
Jim: Um, what's going on here?
Pam: People treat us like the race on our forehead. And then we guess what race we are.
Jim: Ah, good. Good luck. Doing good. [goes to the index cards and writes another race down]
Dwight: Oh, man, am I a woman?
Jim: Yes, yes.
Dwight: God!
Jim: How embarrassing is it? That's not fair. Here...
Dwight: It's not fair.
Jim: Try this. [takes Dwight's 'Asian' race and switches it with the one he wrote]
Dwight: Thank you. Thank you very much.
Jim: Go get 'em.
Dwight: Good. [clears throat] So, am I a hunter gather culture?
Pam: No.
Dwight: Do I live near a harbor or an ocean?
Pam: No.
Dwight: No, I'm an inland. Am I a mountainous?
Pam: No.
Dwight: Am I nomadic?
Pam: No.
Dwight: Okay, okay, okay, okay. I think I got this. Um, I am treated in a foreign way with a great deal of prejudice. Am I one of those tribes in Africa? The piggies, or whatever?
Pam: No.
Dwight: No. But I am, I am human, right? [Pam hesitates]
 
Dwight: [Dwight's new race is 'Dwight'] I could be French.
 
Dwight: [takes his 'Dwight' race off his forehead] Damn it, Jim! That's not funny, Jim!
Oh, okay. Here we go, breakthrough radar. What happened? What happened here?
Pam: It didn't have anything to do with race.
Okay, all right. Let's keep on track. Keep on point. Let's do it.
 
 
Pam: One time we had an ethnic festival in Scranton. One time.
 
Try my googi, googi. [Lowering voice] Try my googi, googi. [High-pitched voice] Try my googi, googi. Try my... [Kelly slaps Michael] All right! All right! Yes! That was great, she gets it! Kelly thank you. [claps] She's not here, but she gets it. That's what we have been looking for. The whole time. [trying not to cry] Oh, man. This is what I thrive on. You know? It's like Don Rickles on acid, man. Right?
Jim: Um, why did she slap Martin Luther King?
What, huh?
Pam: What card was she?
Jim: I think she wasn't wearing a card.
It's good. This is good. We got it happening now. All right? Let's keep it rolling. Let's round it up.
 [clears throat] Hey, what's up?
Jim: Hey.
Any emails today?
Jim: Um... I don't think so.
No? Um... Check your spam folder.
Jim: Oh! There it is!
What?
Jim: Um... 'Fifty signs your priest might be Michael Jackson.'
[laughs uncontrollably]
Jim: Well done.
Kay.
Jim: Topical.
 
I am king of forwards. It's how I like to do business, everybody joking around. We're like 'Friends'. I am Chandler and Joey and, uh, Pam is Rachel. And Dwight is Kramer.
 
Dwight: So the monkey does the sex thing right here! [monkey noises in background]
That's funny! That's funny. Not offensive. Uh... because it's nature. Educational.
Dwight: Do you want the link because then you could forward it around?
Um, I...
Dwight: Consider it?
Yeah... maybe. Maybe. Well, we'll see. Because I... I don't know if it's... [muffled by jacket over his head] Whup! Come on! Hey!
Todd Packer: What has two thumbs and likes to bone your Mom? [points at self] This guy!
Kay! Oh, you are so bad! Yeah!
Todd Packer: [makes laser gun noises]
Oh, Boom! Bam! Oh, this guy is out of control! He is a madman! Better get the bleep button ready for him.
Todd Packer: bleep, bleep. What's up, Halpert?
Uh oh.
Todd Packer: Still queer?
Uh oh! Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-o!
 
Todd Packer and I are total BFF. Best Friends Forever. He and I came up together as salesmen. One time, we were out and we met this set of twins. And Packer told them that we were brothers. And so, you know, one thing led to another, and we brought em back to the motel. And then Packer did both of them. It was awesome. So...
 
Oh-whoa-oh! Oh! Okay. Grade 'A' gossip for you, right now. Randall, CFO, resigned. Nobody knows why.
Todd Packer: Are you kidding? Everyone knows why! You don't know? Okay, check this out. Al lright. So here's the story. So Randall is nailing his secretary, right? And she is totally incompetent.
Really? Here we go! Buckle up. It's going to be a bumpy one!
Todd Packer: We're talking blonde incompetent.
Oh, yeah.
Todd Packer: Like 10 words a minute... talking.
Well, to be fair... blondes, brunettes, you know, there's a lot of dumb people out there.
Todd Packer: They are women, right?
Oh! Wow! I didn't say it! I didn't say it!
Todd Packer: I said it. And then, suddenly, for no reason, this bimbo blows the whistle on the whole thing just to be a bitch.
Oh, wow! What did I tell you about the bleep button.
 
Jim: Hey, um... what has two thumbs and hates Todd Packer? [points at self] This guy!
 
Todd Packer: Meant to ask you, can you think you can get someone to drive me around because of the, uh, DUI situation?
Oh. Bad boy. [to Ryan] Um... Ryan? [makes Donald Duck noise]
Todd Packer: [to Ryan] Come on, kid. Let's go.
Ah! Man. That Todd Packer can do anything.
Jim: Except pass that breathalyzer.
 
Ryan: You a big William Hung fan?
Todd Packer: Why does everyone ask me that? Who the hell is that?
 
Kevin's computer: [monkey noises]
 
Jim: I'm really excited to meet your Mom.
Pam: You are?
 
Pam: My Mom is coming in to visit. And she lives like two hours away. And she doesn't have a cell phone... which is cool cause it's kind of adding some suspense to my day. And I keep looking over at the door hoping she'll walk in.
 
Pam: I've decided to show her around. She really wants to meet everybody.
Jim: Oh yeah?
Pam: mmhmm.
Jim: Good. Cause I have a lot of questions.
Pam: Oh really?
Jim: Yeah. As a child, did Pam show any traits that would hint towards her future career as a receptionist?
 
Hey, send me that link to the monkey sex video. I'm going to forward it like it's hot.
Dwight: Yes!
Forward it like it's hot. Forward it like it's hot. "Old School".
Toby: Michael?
Yes, Toby?
Toby: Um... I need to talk to you in your office. It'll just take two seconds.
Um... literally two seconds?
 
Toby is in HR which technically means he works for Corporate. So he's really not a part of our family. Also he's divorced so he's really not a part of his family.
 
Toby: The full story is that Randall resigned because of sexual harassment. So Corporate asked me to do a five minute review of the Company Sexual Harassment policy.
No, no, Toby. No.
Toby: It's really not a big deal, Michael.
It is a big deal. It's a big deal! What are we supposed to do? Scrutinize every little thing we say and do all day? I mean, come on!
Toby: And then Corporate is going to send in a lawyer...
What?
Toby: Just to refresh you... .
NO!
Toby: on our policy.
What? He! No! Okay, what is a lawyer going to come in and tell us? To not send out hilarious emails or not tell jokes?
Toby: Maybe not some of them. Maybe not inappropriate ones.
There is no such thing as an appropriate joke. That's why it's a joke.
 
Everyone! Hello! Everyone. Hi! Sorry to interrupt. I know you're all busy and the last thing you want is for a major interruption. But Toby has an announcement that he insists on making right now in the middle of the day. [to Toby] So, take it away.
Toby: Yeah, okay. Corporate would like us to do a five minute review of the Company Sexual Harassment policy so I'll go over that later.
I wish you luck, Toby. I really do. But you are going to have a mutiny on your hands and I just can't wait to see how you handle it.
 
A guy goes to a five dollar... lady of the night and he gets crabs. So, the next day he goes back to complain. And the woman says "Hey. It was only five dollars. What did you expect? Lobster?" This is what's at stake.
 
Time to bring out the big guns. I'm heading down to the warehouse where jokes are born. Find a killer joke that'll just blow everybody away at the seminar later. And remind them what is great about this place. So... ah! Here they are. [to Warehouse guys] Guys! Wondering if I could, uh, get your help for something. I'm looking for a new joke to tell and it needs to be just killer. And it does not need to be clean. So whatcha got?
Darryl: Like a joke? A knock-knock joke?
Um, yeah, no, well... I mean better. Better than that. The type of stuff you guys tell all day.
Darryl: Well, [points at Michael] those are some awful tight pants you have on. Where'd you get em? Like Queers R Us?
Roy: Boys R Us!
Warehouse Guy: Oh!
Alright, alright. Well, yeah, but, you know... a joke but not necessarily at my expense.
Darryl: Man, we can see all your business coming around the corner, okay? You need to, you know, hide the... good thing you don't have a lot of business to start with.
Oooh, okay. That was still about me.
Roy: Hey, hey, hey.
What?
Roy: So you don't have the biggest package. Don't feel bad.
I don't feel bad.
Darryl: [fake whispers to Roy] I think he feels bad.
No, I don't.
Roy: You look like you feel bad.
Okay.
Roy: Little package!
Well, not exactly what I was looking for but thanks guys.
Warehouse guy: Little package! Little package!
Thank you.
Roy: You look good.
Darryl: Hiding from his momma.
Warehouse guys: [kissing noises, sheep baaing sounds]
 
Toby: So remember, intent is irrelevant. And that's it. Pam?
Pam: Um... I just wanted to say that... Just, my Mom's coming in today.
Kevin: MILF!
Pam: Thanks, Kevin.
 
Pam: Usually the day we talk about sexual harassment is the day that everyone harasses me as a joke.
 
Pam: She's coming in today and maybe just don't joke around about that stuff in front of her.
Toby: Great point.
Pam: Thank you.
Toby: Um... in fact, basic rule of thumb, let's just act everyday like Pam's Mom's coming in. All right. That's it. Um... if anybody has any questions about anything, you know where I sit in the back.
Hi, is it over?
Toby: Uh, yes!
No.
Toby: I can go over it with you.
I know, I know. It's good. It is not over. It is not over til it's over.
Toby: It's over.
Did he tell you everything? Obviously, he didn't because you all still look relatively happy. Albeit bored. Do you realize what we're losing? Seriously?
Angela: Email forwards.
Exactly! Mmwwah [blows kiss to Angela]! Can we afford to lose email forwards? Do we want that?
Angela: I hate them. You send me these filthy emails and you say forward them to ten people or you'll have bad luck.
Give me a break. Umm... Stanley, how about that hot picture you have by your desk? Centerfold in the Catholic schoolgirl's outfit? I mean, it is hot, it is sexy, and it turns him on. And I will admit, best part of my morning is staring at it. But what? Are we just going to take it away?
Stanley: That is my daughter. She goes to Catholic girls' school. I am taking it down right now.
Meredith: Um... what about office romance?
Toby: Office relationships are never a good idea. Yeah. So let's just try to avoid them. But, um, if you already have one, you should disclose it to HR.
Phyllis: All relationships? Eh, even a one-night stand?
I think the old honor system was just fine. For example, I have never slept with an employee. And, believe me, I could have.
Dwight: Yeah, Meredith.
No! No! Catherine. Remember her? Remember how hot she was?
Dwight: Yes.
She would have definitely slept with me.
Kevin: She wasn't that hot.
Yes, she was. Dammit, Kevin!
Toby: Ok, you know, Michael...
 
Jim: I'm in an office relationship. It's special. Um... she's nice. She's shy. She's actually here. You want to meet her? Hold on one second. Oh, my God! Put on a shirt! Put on a... . I told you that you'd be on camera. I'm sorry, she's European. No, I told you that you'd be on camera. Stop it.
 
What if Pam was a lesbian? What if she brought her "partner" in to work? [to Toby] Would that be crossing the line?
Toby: No.
What if they made out? In front of everybody?
Toby: Well, that would be...
At home? And I told everybody everything about it.
Toby: Okay, I'm lost.
Okay. Well, then let's act it out. Pam, you will be girl A and girl B will be... Okay! We'll use the doll. Pam. Pam?
 
Video: [Crossing the Line: Rules for the Modern Workplace]
I wish Todd Packer was here because he would love this. I wonder if anybody else would like to do this. Hey! Um... we have to watch, uh, Toby's video that he's showing us in order to brainwash us and I was wondering if anybody would like to join in? Going to be fun. Got my great pizza. Whataya say? Jim?
Jim: No, thanks. I'm good.
That's what she said. Pam?
Pam: Uh... my mother's coming.
That's what she sai [clears throat] Nope, but... Okay. Well, suit yourself.
 
Dwight: Hey, Toby.
Toby: Hey Dwight.
Dwight: You said that we could come to you if we had any questions.
Toby: Sure.
Dwight: Where is the clitoris? On a website, it said at the crest of the labia. What does that mean? What does the female vagina look like?
 
Toby: Technically, I am in Human Resources. And Dwight was asking about human anatomy. Um... I'm just sad the public school system failed him so badly.
 
Toby: Yeah, maybe when you get really comfortable with each other, you can ask for that.
Dwight: Good. Good. And...
Toby: I should get back to work.
Dwight: Okay.
 
Man in Video: In today's fast-paced business climate, it can sometimes be hard to know when a comment or an action crosses the line. Let's take a look at a couple of scenarios and ask ourselves 'where is the line?'
Video: [Scenario 1: The Natural Redhead]
Roy: Natural redhead.
Actor: Hey, Rach.
Redheaded Actress: Hey, Joe. Mike.
Actor: Hey, settle a bet. Are you a natural redhead?
Darryl: Oh, Mi... ! Hey, stop the video! Michael, stop it right there! Stop it right there! That's that girl from that thing. [pointing at Redheaded Actress] I banged this girl right here. This is...
Roy: That's her?
Darryl: Yes, this is the one.
Roy: No!
Darryl: You remember? Yes!
Roy: At the party?
Warehouse guy: You banged her?
Darryl: Yes! [to video screen] Right here. You are a naughty girl!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... Okay! Hypocrite! She is a hypocrite. That is such a scam! Okay.
 
Jan: [to cell phone] Yes. Yes, I did. Okay. Well, we can talk about that later then. [to Pam] Hi.
Okay, you are never going to believe this. The girl in the video we're watching that Corporate gave us... Darryl banged her! Aaand is about 90% sure.
 
Todd Packer: Don't ever let this little bitch drive you around town. We got, uh, lost for half an hour.
Pam: I don't have any DUI's so I can drive myself, but thanks.
Todd Packer: Where is Michael Snot? Sniffing some dude's thong? Probably.
 
So you are the lawyer, Mr. O'Malley? I know a lot of lawyer jokes.
Mr. O'Malley: I love lawyer jokes.
Well, it's probably because you don't get 'em.
 
When I said before that I was king of forwards, you got to understand that I don't come up with this stuff. I just forward it along. You wouldn't arrest a guy who's just delivering drugs from one guy to another.
 
Jan: You seem a little bit agitated, Michael. What's the problem?
The problem is that I am the boss and apparently I can't say anything.
Jan: Well, that... that's true in a way. You can't say anything.
Where's the line? Where's the line, Jan.
Jan: Do you need to see the video again, Michael?
No, I've seen the video.
Toby: [to Jan] He talked the whole time.
No, I didn't. [to Jan] Huh, what? [everyone looks up at blow-up doll]
 
Attention, everyone! Hello! Ah, yes! I just want you to know that, uh, this is not my decision, but from here on out... we can no longer be friends. And when we talk about things here we must only discuss work-associated things. And, uh, you can consider this my retirement from comedy. And in the future, if I want to say something funny or witty or do an impression, I will no longer, ever, do any of those things.
Jim: Does that include 'That's What She Said'?
Mmmhmm. Yes.
Jim: Wow! That is really hard. You really think you can go all day long? Well, you always left me satisfied and smiling, so...
THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID!
Jan: Michael. MICHAEL!
[laughing] Come on.
Jan: Michael, please.
Todd Packer: There he is.
Mwah! [kisses hand and salutes office]
Todd Packer: There he is. Good one.
 
You would have done the same. You just didn't think of it first.
Jan: Mike... Michael. Please. I... I... really.
It's... That's...
Jan: That's not my sense of humor.
Okay. [to man entering office] Hello. [introduces] Jan. Mr. O'Malley. This is my lawyer, James P. Albiny.
Jan: Wha...
I believe you may recognize his face from the billboards. He specializes in Free Speech issues.
Albiny: [to camera] And motorcycle head injuries, worker's comp, and diet pill lawsuits.
This guy does it all.
Jan: [to Albiny] 'Scuse me, I'm sorry. [to Michael] Michael. Mr. O'Malley is your lawyer.
What?
Jan: Mr. O'Malley is our Corporate lawyer. We have him on retainer. To protect the company as well as upper level management, such as yourself.
So I'm not in trouble?
 
I am so used to being the bad boy. I am so used to fighting Corporate that I forget that I am Corporate. Upper management. They hooked me up with an attorney. To protect me. You can't be too careful about what you say. Mo' money, mo' problems.
 
Okay. Well, let's get you out of here, James. Um... I think we're under an hour still, so...
Albiny: Yeah, but I did a lot of paperwork at home before I got here.
I know. We'll talk about it later. Thanks for coming in.
 
Pam's Mom: Um... hello.
Pam: [ecstatic] Oh my god!
Pam's Mom: Finally made it!
Pam: Hello!
 
Pam: I love my Mom. Okay. That's probably really the most obvious statement ever.
 
Pam's Mom: This is all yours?
Pam: Yeah. I'm in charge of this whole area.
Pam's Mom: Oh, my goodness. That's great.
 
Todd Packer: So a guy goes home, tells his wife, "Honey. Pack your bags. I just won the lottery." She goes, "Oh my god! That's incredible! Where are we going?" He goes, "I don't know where you're going, just be out of here by five!" [men laugh] Boom!
 
Pam: This is where I used to keep my computer.
Pam's Mom: Oh, right! I remember...
Pam: But then I moved it.
Pam's Mom: with the picture.
Pam: Yeah, yeah, but I uh... I switched stuff around because I actually needed like more room for organization. So...
Pam's Mom: Sure.
Pam: So this is like, um, an organization station...
Pam's Mom: [to Roy] Oooooh!
Pam: Hey!
Pam's Mom: Well, there he is!
Roy: How are ya?
Pam's Mom: Hi, handsome!
Roy: You look great!
Pam's Mom: Oh, thank you! So! We ready for dinner?
Pam: Well, you know... actually, I kind of need to stall a bit. But, it's okay, because I am very used to killing time.
Pam's Mom: Oh, I don't believe that.
Roy: Okay, I'm going to go wait in the parking lot. And what kind of tunes you want for the ride? Little, uh, classical? Or oldies?
Pam's Mom: Oh, anything is fine.
Roy: All right, I'll see ya.
Pam's Mom: So which one is Jim?
Pam: Mom!
Pam's Mom: I just wanted to know.
Pam: No.
Pam's Mom: All right. Okay.
Pam: Ten minutes.
Pam's Mom: Okay.
Pam: Then we can go to dinner.
Pam's Mom: I'll make myself busy.
 
Todd Packer: There's this guy. He's at a Nymphomaniac Convention. And he is psyched 'cause all these women are smokin' hot perfect 10's, except for this one chick who looks a lot like, uh... [points at Phyllis]
Kevin: Phyllis?
No. No, no, no. That crosses the line.
Todd Packer: Ex-squeeze me?
Not you. Kevin. Just unwarranted. Hostile work environment, Kevin.
Kevin: Packer said it.
No. You said it. He pointed. A point is not a say. Look. Kevin, we are a family here and Phyllis is a valued member of that family. Like a grandmother.
Phyllis: I'm the same age as you, Michael.
I don't know about that.
Phyllis: We're in the same High School class.
Well, I have a late birthday and usually September's a cut-off point. [to Kevin] You know what? You just crossed the line. Okay? There's a line and you went over it. And you must be punished. So go to your corner.
Kevin: You mean where my desk is?
Yes, your corner. Go.
Kevin: Okay. I have a lot of work to do anyway.
Mmmhmmm.
Todd Packer: Oh my. They really got to you, didn't they?
They didn't get to me. I got to them. I am still the same old Michael Scott. New and improved. You know what? I love Phyllis. You know what else? I think she is gorgeous. I think she is incredibly, incredibly attractive person. [to Phyllis] C'mere, c'mere, c'mon! Come on! Come on.
Phyllis: Michael! Come on!
Oooh!
Phyllis: You don't have to worry. I'm not going to...
I'm not worried.
Phyllis: ...report you to HR.
You know what? The only thing I'm worried about... is getting a boner. Good work today, everybody.
 
Times have changed a little. And even though we're still a family here at Dunder-Mifflin, families grow. And at some point, the daddy can't take a bath with the kids anymore. I am Upper Management. And it would be inappropriate for me to take a bath with Pam. As much as I might want to.
 
Pam: He said what?
 
 
 
Good morning, Pam.
Pam: Good morning, Michael.
What's going on?
Pam: Nothing. You look nice today.
What?
Pam: You look real thin.
I don't get what you mean.
Pam: You just... You look good. Your shirt looks... You look real good.
Well, you said I looked thin, so what does... Does that mean I'm like thin weird or thin handsome or... [laughing]
Pam: Thin handsome, Michael.
Yes, well, of course. Of course. [laughing]
 
 
Dwight: Wait, Jim, no! Don't drink directly from the can. Okay, I'm serious. It's all over the Internet. They use the same shipping company as a rat poison, and it gets on the can. [Jim takes a drink] Well, you're an idiot.
Jim: What can I say, Dwight, I live a very dangerous life.
 
 
Kevin: [Email chiming] [snickers] Did you see that?
Oscar: I saw it.
Kevin: You can see her...
Angela: It's fake.
Kevin: How do you know?
Angela: She wouldn't do that. She's a Senator.
 
 
Office romance. For example, Pam and I are dating, do we have to disclose that?
Pam: We're not dating.
No, but I'm saying hypothetically if we were dating...
Pam: We're not dating, I'm engaged.
Well, Roy is dead, and I ask you out.
Pam: I would say no.
You say yes, and we go out.
Pam: I would drown myself.
And now Roy and Pam are dead, and we have your stupid rules to blame, Toby.
 
 
Toby actually gets alimony from his ex-wife because she makes more, so that's kind of embarrassing. Not that I'd mind, but it would never happen to me because I would make the marriage work. People seem to like him because they think he's one of us, but he's not. He's this weird loner who just tells people, "Don't do this, don't do that. Hire this person for this reason." I would complain about him, but who would I go to, to complain about Toby? Toby. Bias. And what does he do about that? Nothing. Because he's Toby. What kind of name is that? It's almost a girl's name. I think I've known more girls named Toby than guys. He just kind of makes my skin crawl a little bit. Toby is the devil. Toby's the devil.
 
 
Pam: Hey.
Jim: Hey.
Pam: I know we're having that harassment thing this afternoon.
Jim: Yeah.
Pam: Sometimes when we IM, I send you that little winking face with the lipstick.
Jim: Yeah?
Pam: Yeah. I realize that might be harassment.
Jim: Yes, it is harassment and I'm going to be suing the winking face. I've hired the angry face as my lawyer and you will be hearing from him pretty soon.
Pam: Okay.
Jim: Okay. [IM chiming] [laughing]

 Pam: Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Sure, can I ask who's calling? Just a second.
Jim: Jim Halpert. What? How did you get this number? Stalker.
 
Pam: Katy and Jim met in the office. And now I guess they're like going out, or dating, or something. And, uh... I don't know! You know? They're just... She calls him, and they... You know, I'm sorry. I feel like I'm talking really loud. Am I talking really loud?
 
Jim: So we're still on for lunch? You're meeting me here? Okay. Great. Bye.
Pam: [to Jim] Hey! You can just give her your extension.
Jim: Okay.
 
Howard, slash Ryan, Ryan Howard is sitting in my office. And he has been a temp here for a couple of months and he's kind of gotten the lay of the land a little bit. Had a few laughs along the way. And now he wants to know what I think.
Ryan: The temp agency wants to know what you think.
Shall we? Let us proceed. First up, proficiency in necessary skills. Aaaaeeexcellent! [laughs]
 
Dwight: Michael's in there right now evaluating the temp. He hasn't evaluated me in years.
 
Five years from now, what do you want to do? Where do you want to be?
Ryan: Ah, well, I'm interested in business.
Oh! Good. Ambitious. Excellent. Want to be a manager?
Ryan: Uh, no, actually, uh, what I want is to own my own company.
That is ridiculous.
 
Ryan's about to attend the Michael Scott School of Business. I'm like Mr. Miyagi and Yoda rolled into one.
 
[speaks in a Yoda voice] Much advice you seek. [regular voice] Do you know who that is?
Ryan: Fozzie bear?
Mmm... No. That was Yoda.
 
There are ten rules of business that you need to learn. Number one: You need to play to win. But... you also have to win to play.
Ryan: Got it.
And I will give you the rest of the ten at lunch.
 
[to Ryan] [makes clicking noises like shooting a gun] Hey!
 
Dwight: Michael and I have a very special connection. He's like Batman, I'm like Robin. He's like the Lone Ranger, and I'm like Tonto. And it's not like there was the Lone Ranger, and Tonto, and Bonto.
 
Oscar: [in background, on phone] But it says no late fee... .
Dwight: [alarm sounds] People!
Angela: Okay! Everybody!
Dwight: This is not a test! Move to the exits!
Angela: Do not panic!
Dwight: Head towards the exits.
Angela: Safety partners.
Dwight: Get up off your desks!
Angela: Do not panic.
Oscar: [in phone] No, I don't hear it? Alright.
Dwight: No, panic is warranted!
Angela: Go in single file lines.
Oscar: [in phone] No, no. Finish the...
Dwight: This is not at drill!
Angela: Arms at your sides! Arms at your sides!
Dwight: Please, move quickly! This is a paper company, people! Step lively!
Angela: Go, let's go.
Dwight: This whole place is a tinder box, it is ready to blow!
 
Dwight: This is not a test! Can you leave?!
Phyllis: Oh, you say that every time.
Dwight: DO YOU WANT TO DIE?
Phyllis: Oh, boy...
Dwight: Do you want to die? OUT!!
Angela: Alright, let's go, let's go.
Dwight: STANLEY! Have you ever seen a burn victim?
Angela: Come on, you're safety partners!
Dwight: Move to the exits!
Angela: You're safety partners!
Dwight: We've got smoke! We've got smoke! Smoke! Gah! [Spots Kelly] Oh, Kelly! You're okay! I've got you!
Kelly: I'm okay!
Dwight: Cover your nose and mouth. Breathe through your nose.
Kelly: Let go of me!
Dwight: Breathe through your nose. Remove your stockings. Okay? They'll melt right into your flesh! Stay below the smoke line. Let's go! Clear out, stat! STAT MEANS NOW!
 
Yes, I was the first one out. And, yes, I've heard women and children first. But, we do not employ children. We are not a sweat shop. Thankfully. And, uh, women are equal in the workplace by law. So, I let them out first, I have a lawsuit on my hands.
 
Another rule of business is being able to adapt to different situations.
Ryan: Yeah.
Adapt. React. Re-adapt. Act. All right? That's rule number two.
 
Dwight: Okay, guys, listen up, we need a head count. We need to count off. Michael's number one. Where is he? Where is he?
 
So what was rule two?
Ryan: Ah... adapt, react, re-adapt, act.
Okay, well, let's... . let's kind of take it a little slower.
Dwight: Hey, Michael. Um... Ryan needs his number for the count off.
Okay, uh, well, one is taken.
Ryan: Uh, okay, two?
Dwight: NO!
Ryan: Okay... uh, sorry?
 
Dwight: Okay, he can have 14. Marjory's not here today.
Well, he needs a permanent number, right?
Ryan: No.
 
Ryan: ...I don't.
Dwight: Oh, you know what else? I thought of a nickname for the three of us. Three Musketeers.
Um, yeah. Okay. That... No, no, no. I got one. I got one. The Three Stooges.
Dwight: That's funny, too. But if we're the Three Musketeers...
 
Ryan: I don't want to be like "a guy" here. You know? Like, Stanley is the "crossword puzzle guy". And Angela has cats. I don't want to have a thing... here. You know, I don't want to be the "something guy".
 
Jim: Okay, you know what? I am going to be, uh, setting the agenda here. Okay? Can everybody gather up, please? Important announcement. Very important announcement. I think this is a perfect opportunity for all of us to participate in some really intense, psychologically revealing conversations. So we're going to be playing Desert Island, umm, Who Would You Do?
Stanley: Ooh.
Jim: And, um...
Pam: ...Would You Rather?
Jim: Would You Rather. Would You Rather is our third game.
 
Dwight: [to firemen] Hey guys, great response time. Listen up, I got some theories. Okay, there's a...
 
Jim: Okay, so... three books on a desert island? Angela.
Angela: The Bible.
Stanley: That's one book. You've got two others.
Angela: A Purpose Driven Life.
Jim: Nice. Third book?
Angela: No.
Jim: Okay. Phyllis.
Phyllis: Um, The DaVinci Code.
Angela: The DaVinci Code!
Jim: Nice.
Angela: I would take The DaVinci Code... so I could burn The DaVinci Code.
Dwight: Okay. Great, that's going to keep you warm for like 7 seconds. Question: is there fire wood on the island?
Jim: I guess.
Dwight: Then I would bring an axe, no books.
Jim: Uh, it has to be a book, Dwight.
Dwight: Fine. Physician's Desk Reference.
Jim: Nice. Smart.
Dwight: ...hollowed out, inside: waterproof matches, iodine tablets, beet seeds, protein bars, NASA blanket, and, in case I get bored, Harry Potter and Sorcerer's Stone. No, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Question: did my shoes come off in the plane crash?
 
Rule number four. In business, image is everything - Andre Agassi. This car is an investment. Right? If I have to take out a client or I'm seen around Scranton in it. I love it. I love this car. Do you like it?
Ryan: Yeah.
 
Jim: Okay. Thought people read more books.
 
Jim: DVDs! Five movies. What would you bring to the island? Yes! Meredith?
Meredith: Legends of the Fall, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Legally Blond, Bridges of Madison County...
 
Jim: Wow.
Pam: Legends of the Fall?
Jim: Wow. Bridges of Madison County, Legally Blond, these movies are just... .
Pam: Well, I kind of liked Legal...
Jim: Wait, wait, wait. Pam. No. Do you understand? The... the game is Desert Island Movies, not guilty pleasure movies. Desert Island Movies are the movies you're going to watch for the rest of your life! Forever! Unforgivable.
Pam: I take it back.
Jim: Unforgivable.
Pam: I take it back!
Jim: Good.
 
Meredith: ...and Ghost. But, ah, just that one scene...
 
Dwight: Is this your car, Ryan?
Wow, some pretty big books back there, huh?
Ryan: [to Dwight] Don't...
Dwight: Good shocks.
Hello, Mr. Egghead! Woop! So... oh, Stanley Kaplan! I know him. 'M' is for Murder, 'P' is for...
Ryan: That's actually a test prep book.
...for Phone. What?
Ryan: That's a test prep for business school.
Um, oh, thinking about business school?
Ryan: I just got in. I applied, I go at night.
Really?
Ryan: Yeah.
So you think you know a lot about business?
Ryan: No, not yet.
Uh huh.
Ryan: Just started.
Yeah. Quiz me.
Ryan: I... wouldn't even know where to start.
Come on, egghead. Let's do it.
Dwight: Do it.
Quiz me up.
Ryan: All right, um... Why have people been rethinking the Microsoft model in the past few years?
Uh...
 
When I was Ryan's age, I worked in a fast food restaurant, to save up money for school. And then I spe... lost it in a pyramid scheme. But I learned more about business, right then and there, than business school would ever teach me, or Ryan would ever teach me.
 
Ryan: Is it cheaper to sign a new customer? Or to keep an existing customer?
Dwight: Keep an existing...
[to Dwight] Shut, it. Can I... can I just do it please? [to Ryan] Uh, it's equal.
Ryan: It is ten times more expensive to sign a new customer.
Okay. Yes! It was a trick question.
Dwight: Yeah, but look, I mean, he didn't need business school. Okay, Michael comes from the school of hard knocks.
Okay, Dwight.
Dwight: Self taught. You didn't even go to college.
You know what, Dwight? You don't need to help me here. Okay? Well, you know... Maybe you should go to business school like Ryan, then... then you'd know what you're talking about.
Dwight: [scoffs] Come on. I'm studying with the master, huh?
For instance, why don't you go to business...
Dwight: [to Ryan] You should learn from him, right?
Ryan: I am.
Dwight: Right?
Ryan: I am.
Stop. Dwight. You know what? You're acting like a dork. Would you cool it? Please. Okay. Hey! He's not your five year old brother, Dwight. He's a valued member of this company... and you know what? He knows more about business than you ever will.
Dwight: Stupid!
 
I did not go to business school. You know who else didn't go to business school? LeBron James, Tracy McGrady, Kobe Bryant. They went right from high school to the NBA. So... so it's not the same thing. At all.
 
Look at this stuff. Market fragments. What is that supposed to be?
Ryan: It's a way of looking at consumers as subsets of a larger client base.
You are so smart. You are so eff-in' smart. You should be teaching me.
 
Jim: Pam? Get us back into it.
Pam: Okay.
Jim: Five movies. Go ahead.
Pam: Um, Fargo, um, Edward Scissorhands, Dazed and Confused...
Jim: Ooh, definitely in my top five.
Pam: Yes. In my top three, so suck it.
Jim: What?
Pam: Breakfast Club. Um... The Princess Bride and...
Jim: Okay that's five.
Pam: No, my all time favorite!
Jim: Pam, play by the rules.
Pam: All time favorite.
Jim: Play by the rules. Dwight. All time favorite movie.
Dwight: The Crow.
 
I became a salesman... because of people, I love making friends. But then I was promoted to manager, at a very young age. I still try to be a friend first, but... You know? I'm very successful... your coworkers look at you differently. Huu, what do you think?
Ryan: Maybe we should get some air.
Nah, I'm okay.
Ryan: I'm really uncomfortable.
 
Jim: All right. Let's move on. Let's move on to the main event. Who Would You Do?
Kevin: Present company excluded?
Jim: Um, not neccessari...
Kevin: Pam.
Oscar: Pam.
Jim: Um... okay. Ah, you know what? Maybe I'll... I'll finish explaining the rules. Let's... let me explain it first, and then...
song: ["Everybody Hurts" by R.E.M.] Think you've had too much / in this life.
Jim: Yeah, so we'll get right... You know what? I'll be right back. Stanley, you're taking over for me, buddy. I'll be right back.
Stanley: Okay, um...
 
Jim: Dwight. Dwight.
Song: Everybody hurts,
Jim: Come on Dwight! Use words.
Song: Sometim... .
Dwight: Why didn't I go to business school?
Jim: Who goes to business school?
Dwight: The temp.
Jim: He does?
Dwight: Yeah, it's all him and Michael talk about anymore.
Pam: You know, I bet Ryan thinks to himself 'I wish I were a volunteer sheriff on the weekends'.
Dwight: He doesn't even know that I do that.
Pam: You should tell him.
Dwight: Oh yeah, Pam. Right. That's going to help things, just talk it out. I hope the war goes on forever and Ryan gets drafted.
Pam: Dwight.
Jim: What?
Dwight: I'm sorry I said that, I didn't... just part of me meant it. Besides, he'd end up being a hero anyway.
Jim: You know what you should do? You should quit. And then, that would stick it to both of them.
Dwight: Oh Jim, I'm not going to quit. Then Ryan wins.
Jim: Yeah. You're right.
Dwight: Thanks you guys. I just need some alone time.
Pam: Kay.
Song: Everybody hurts
Jim: Alright buddy.
Song: Everybody cries
Roy: Hey! Guys, what's going on?
Jim: Nothing.
Pam: Hey!
Song: Everybody hurts
Roy: What's up? Can I hang out with you guys for a bit?
Song: Sometimes
Roy: The warehouse guys are a bunch of jackasses sometimes.
 
Stanley: Come on people, you know the rules of the game now.
Oh, hey. Game, what game are we playing here?
Stanley: Okay. It's called Who Would You Do?
Oh, I play this at home all the time while I'm falling asleep. What, uh... . Where are we? Where are we here? Mmm.. Roy? Roy? Who would you do, Roy?
Roy: Uh... Oh, I got it! Uh, what's the name of that, uh, tight ass, uh, Christian, uh, chick. The, uh, the blond?
Angela: My name is Angela.
Roy: Hey, Angela! Roy. Nice to meet you.
Aaaall right. Who's next, who's next, who's next, who's? Jim? You're next. Who would you do?
Jim: Um... Kevin, hands down. Yeah. He's really got that teddy bear thing going on, and afterwards, we could just watch bowling.
Well, I would definitely have sex with Ryan. 'Cause he is going to own his own business.
Roy: You're all gay.
Who's, uh... Who's next? Who we got? Whooo...
Ryan: [answers phone] Hey, no, I can talk, I can talk, I can talk... this is great timing.
Wish I had my cell phone, but I left it inside. So...
Dwight: Would that make you happy?
What's that?
Dwight: If you had your cell phone, it would make you happy?
Yeah.
Dwight: I'm on it.
Dwight. Hey!
Angela: You can't go in yet!
Dwight, don't! He is an idiot. The man is an idiot, ladies and gentlemen.
Kevin: What if he dies in the fire? And that's the last thing you ever said to him.
I didn't say it to him. I said it about him.
 
Meredith: ...Jim.
Phyllis: Definitely Jim.
Kelly: Definitely, definitely, Jim.
Phyllis: Come on, Pam.
Kelly: How about you Pam?
Pam: Um... Oscar's kind of cute.
Phyllis: Yeah, I like Oscar.
Pam: Ooh, Toby!
[in the background] How long does it take to find a cell phone? I don't know either.
Meredith: Is there anybody else.
Kevin: [clears his throat]
 
Jim: [on the phone] Hey, where are you? Oh good. Yeah. We're just here, we're playing Desert Island. It's when you pick your five favorite DVDs...
Seriously, where the hell is Dwight? Hey, call my cell phone. It'll make it easier for him to find.
Ryan: What's your number?
I gave it to you in the car.
Ryan: Um...
I saw you program it in.
Ryan: You got to... you got to give it to me again.
Okay. Alright.
Ryan: Now I have it.
Uh, I better tell somebody. [to fireman] Excuse me, sir...
Dwight: [coughing]
Dwight!? Great goin'. God, Man! Why did you go in there? What... Everybody was scared out of their wits, man? Oooh.
Dwight: [coughing] Everyone, okay? Uh, I have an announcement. Apparently, in business school, they don't teach you how to operate a toaster oven. Because some smart, sexy temp left his cheese pita on oven instead of timing it for the toaster thing.
Wow. Okay. Well, I guess they don't teach how to operate a toaster oven in business school.
Dwight: That's exactly what I said.
Hey, did you miss that day there, Ryan?
Dwight: Were you absent?
Toaster Oven 101?
Dwight: You failed?
Ryan: I am so sorry.
 
Hey! I know what'll impress everybody, I'll start a fire. Oh, man. Bad idea. Bad idea jeans.
 
Dwight: I have a song. Attention, everyone! That I want to sing. That I wrote especially for this occasion when I was up there among the flames. Ready? [sings to Billy Joel's "We Didn't Start the Fire"] Ryan started the fire! It was always burning since the world's been turning!
Dwight and [singing] Ryan started the fire! It was always burning---
Dwight: Everybody!
[singing] ...since the world was turning.
 
Ryan: I can't believe I started the fire.
 
Dwight and [sing gibberish to "We Didn't Start the Fire"]
Dwight: [singing] ... Marilyn Monroe!
Dwight and [singing] Ryan started the fire! It was always burning...
Dwight: Eat it! You gotta eat it. You have to eat it!
 
Katy: Hi!
Jim: Hey.
Katy: How are you?
Jim: Good, how are you?
Katy: I'm good. It's good to see you.
Jim: Good to see you, too.
Katy: I'm hungry.
Jim: Yeah, I am too.
Katy: Oh, I have been thinking the whole way over and I have my answers.
Jim: What answers?
Katy: Um, for the... the desert island.
Jim: Oh! Right! Right, right, right, come-ah on, on, on. [to everyone] Ladies and gentlemen! Gather around! We have one more participant. Come on, be polite. Be polite. [to Katy] Desert Island. Five movies. Go.
Katy: Okay, um, first, Legally Blond.
 
Pam: I forgot what a super, nice girl Katy is. And just... good for Jim! They are so cute together. And, um, what an adorable car.
 
Jim: Okay, I think the game's over... People are like leaving. There was a bigger crowd last time. Do you just want to go to lunch?
Katy: Okay.
Jim: Yeah?
Katy: Alright! You want to drive?
Jim: Sure.
Katy: Alright.
 
Katy: [looking at Roy and Pam] They are soo cute.
 
Ryan: I'm really sorry, Dwight.
Dwight: Answer me this, though.
Ryan: What?
Dwight: Was it worth it? Was it worth it temp?
Ryan: No.
Kevin: Was it worth it?
Dwight: Really?
Ryan: I'm really sorry, Dwight.
Dwight: The fire guy! The fire guy!
 
Dwight: [sings] Joe McCarthy, Richard Nixon, Studebaker, television, North Korea, South Korea, Marilyn Monroe, Ryan started the fire!
 
Okay. Rule five - safety first, i.e. don't burn the building down. Okay? That should be a no brainer.
 
Oh... look! Ryan is book smart. And I am street smart. And book smart.
 
I'll give you the rest of the ten tomorrow.
 
 
 
Jim: Seventy and clear, that's nice. Where's that?
Pam: That's here.
 
 
Dwight: I'm Michael's number two. He's one, I'm two. He's Alpha, I'm Beta. He's A, I'm B. It's easy. Whatever Michael is, I'm one less.
 
 
Rule three: Reach for the stars. And if you fail, see rule four. Rule four: Failure is not an option.
Dwight: Oh, my God. Ryan is gonna love these.
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. And at the end I will reveal, that they were all just one rule.
Dwight: That is so cool.
Mmm-hmm.
Dwight: Plus you can go, "Rule five, see rule six. Rule six, see rule five."
No, I'm not trying to trick him. I'm trying to be a good mentor. So...
Dwight: Kill or be killed.
No.
Dwight: Shoot to kill, or kill to shoot.
No, come on, Dwight, I have to have 10 of these by lunch, I promised Ryan.
Dwight: You could ask for an extension.
I'm not asking the temp for an extension unless I really need it.
 
 
Dwight: I know Michael's every move. It's not something you can just pick up. I could write a book about him. Literally. I started once, but Michael made me stop.
 
 
Dwight: Hey, how's it going, man?
Ryan: Good. What's up?
Dwight: Oh, nothing much. What's up with you?
Ryan: I'm good, thanks.
Dwight: Good. Good, I'm good, too. How's it cracking?
Ryan: Uh, fine. What's up?
Dwight: You know what you would love? Guns N' Roses. When I was your age, I loved Guns N' Roses. Do you like Guns N' Roses? I'll make you a tape.
Ryan: Cool.
Dwight: I'll make you two tapes.
Ryan: I don't have a tape player. So...
Dwight: Someday, temp. I've got a couple of shirts that don't fit so well anymore. I'll bring them by. Okay, see you later.
 
 
Dwight: Michael and I have a very special connection, like an umbilical cord. And the thing is with Ryan is that I don't want him to trip on it, or get it caught around his neck.
 
 
Kevin: Sixty-three, sixty-four, sixty-five, sixty-six, sixty-seven, sixty-eight. [snickering] Sixty-nine. Seventy. Seventy-one, seventy-two, seventy-three.
 
 
Pam: I like fire drills. You know what's the greatest? Like, when you were in school and the teacher would let you have class outside.
Jim: Oh, the best.
Pam: Yeah, it was great because it was like you're supposed to be working, but nothing ever gets done.
Jim: Yeah, we had outside classes all the time and we never did anything.
Pam: [chuckling]
Jim: Actually if I had fewer outside classes, I probably wouldn't be stuck here at a paper company.
Pam: You're not stuck.
 
 
Angela: Yes, there is a real fire, but it's okay. Everyone got out fine. This is why you practice these things.
 
 
Yes, yes, I ran out first. A captain is always the first one on the ship and the last one off the ship. And this parking lot is our ship when the building is on fire. So, I ran out onto the ship.
 
 
Jim: Okay, DVDs. Five movies. What would you bring to the island? Toby, go ahead.
Toby: Say Anything, The Shining, Annie Hall, that's too obvious.
Jim: Those are like my favorite movies. I didn't really think you could win Desert Island, but I think you just did.
Toby: Toy Story 2, one of the best movies I ever saw. I went for my daughter and stayed because you can't leave your daughter in a theater.
 
 
Jim: Toby and I used to sit together until Michael moved us because he thought we talked too much.
Pam: Really?
Jim: Yeah.
 
 
Jim: Kevin, do it.
Kevin: Uh, Cannonball Run, Cannonball Run II, [snickering] Weekend at Bernie's, Weekend at Bernie's II, and, oh, Groundhog Day.
Jim: Groundhog Day.
Stanley: I have a client who watches that movie once a week, at least.
Kevin: Really?
Stanley: I should put you in touch with him. Maybe we could get together and work on that account.
Kevin: I would love that.
Jim: Okay, guys, guys, guys. That almost sounded like business, and we are trying to focus here today, okay?
 
 
When I was Ryan's age, I worked at Arby's and then I worked selling cutlery for a while. Cutlery that could decimate a penny, I kid you not. There were these shears that could cut straight through a penny. So I have life experience and work experience that Ryan doesn't, and will never have.
 
 
Jim: And then you go to school for three years.
Ryan: For two years, and it's only at night, and then it's on your resume forever.
Jim: Wow. And just out of curiosity, how much is it?
Ryan: $650 bucks
Jim: A semester?
Ryan: A credit.
Jim: Wow.
Ryan: It's an investment.
Jim: Oh, yeah, it sounds like it.
Ryan: I think it's worth it.
 
 
If I could change the life of one person, just one person. I... Actually, that's shooting kind of low. I already did that when I was born. I changed two people's lives. Mom and Dad. Um, if I could change the lives of 5,000 people... 10,000. No, five. I'd be satisfied with 5,000. I... 10,000 though, that'd be something. Wow, 10,000 people. Because, you know what? Even one is amazing.
 Kelly: Here you go.
Nice dress, Ryan.
Kelly: It's not a dress. It's a kurta.
[laughing] OK.
 
Tonight, one of our most ethnic co-workers, Kelly, has invited us all to a Diwali celebration put on by her community. What is Diwali, you may ask? Well, to have Kelly explain it [girly voice] it's ada blah blah blah, it's so super fun and it's going to be great. [normal voice] Lot of gods with unpronounceable names. Twenty minutes later you find out that is essentially a Hindu Halloween.
 
Kelly: You look so handsome.
Pam: Really you do. I love the material.
Kelly: I know.
How come you didn't get me one?
Kelly: I...
 
Phyllis: Ok, so, between Meredith's Mini-van and if I borrow Bob's Yukon that should fit about twelve people.
Pam: I actually might not go. Feeling kind of tired.
Meredith: Do you want to make Appletini's and watch 'Sex and the City' at my place?
Pam: Oh, I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
 
Kelly: I don't get why you won't go. Did I do something wrong? I mean, I thought we were really close friends.
Pam: I just feel kind of tired, you know.
Dwight: Maybe you've got mono.
Pam: Maybe. I just ...I don't really have anyone to go with.
Kelly: Well, go with Dwight. He's single, too. Right?
Dwight: Yeah, totally single. Hundred percent available.
 
Kevin: Are you guys going to this Indian thing tonight?
Roy: I don't know. Who's... uh, who's going?
Kevin: Oooh. Do you mean like, is Pam going?
Angela: Don't go. They eat monkey brains.
Hey. Hey. Stop that. That is offensive. Indians do not eat monkey brains. And if they do... sign me up... because I am sure that they are very tasty and nutritional.
 
It's important that this company celebrates its diversity. And you know what, Stanley? Come Kwanzaa time, I have got you covered, baby.
Stanley: I don't celebrate Kwanzaa.
Wha? Really? You should! It's fun.
 
I love the people here. And if there was one thing I di... don't really care for is that they can be terribly, terribly ignorant about other cultures. And I don't want them embarrassing me in front of my girlfriend, Carol.
 
Diwali is a very important holiday for the Hindus. But, frankly, I'm a little appalled that none of you know very much about Indian culture. So, without further ado, Kelly you are on.
Kelly: Um... Diwali is awesome... and there's food... and there's going to be dancing... and... Oh! I got the raddest outfit. It has, um...
Kelly?
Kelly: Sparkles...
Um... why don't you tell us a little bit about the origins of the holiday.
Kelly: Oh, um... I don't know. It's really old, I think.
Angela: How many gods do you have?
Kelly: Like hundreds, I think. Maybe more than that.
Angela: [points at picture on the wall] And that blue busty gal? What's her story?
Kevin: She looks like Pam from the neck down.
Dwight: Pam wishes. [generalized laughing] Kelly, I'll take this one. Diwali is a Celebration of the Coronation of the God-King Rama. After his epic battle with Ravana, the Demon King of Lanka. It symbolizes the battle between good and evil...
All right, all right, all right, all right. This isn't 'Lord of the Rings'.
 
Jim: Sorry.
 
Jim: I started biking into work. Josh does it and he lives a lot farther away than I do. And also it saves gas money, keeps me in shape... helps the environment. And now I know it makes me really sweaty for work.
 
Karen: Nice basket.
Jim: Thank you.
 
Now, a lot of people say that Kelly is one in a million and that's true, but it's also not true. Because, frankly, there are literally billions of people just like Kelly in the world. Here are some famous Indians. [slide show] Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar. He is a Nobel prize-winning physicist. Impressive. Apu from the Simpsons. Hilarious. Indian. M. Night Shyamalan. 'The Village', 'Unbreakable', 'Sixth Sense', 'Sig... '
Dwight: I see dead people.
Okay. Spoiler... alert.
Dwight: He was dead the whole time.
Just stop it. [slide of Michael & Carol kissing] What's the... oh, whoa! [laughs] Where did that come from?
 
Tony: Karen, my chips got stuck in the vending machine again. I need your skinny, little arms.
Karen: Oh. Did you shake it?
Tony: Yeah, I shook it, I shook it.
 
Andy: We have such a roller coaster thing, Karen and I.
Jim: 'Scuse me?
Andy: Roller-coastery friendship. Hot. Cold. On again. Off again. Sexual tension filled type of deal. It's very Sam and Diane.
Jim: Wow.
Andy: From 'Cheers'.
Jim: Yup.
 
And another thing about the Indian people... they love sex positions. I present to you the Kama Sutra. I mean look at that. Who's seen that before?
Creed: I have. That's the 'Union of the Monkey'.
Meredith: Oh, that's what they call it.
Kevin: This is the best meeting we've ever had.
Thank you, Kevin.
Angela: I find this incredibly offensive.
Well, I find it beautiful.
Angela: Well, whatever Kelly wants to do in her own house is fine but we shouldn't all be subjected to it.
No...
Toby: Actually, she's right. This isn't appropriate. Why don't I take these.
No, You're not going to collect them.
Toby: Yes.
No. This is delightful, charming culture.
 
My Indian Culture Seminar was going great until Toby decided that he was too immature to deal with culturally explicit images. It's just sex. People... everybody does it. I'm doing it... with Carol! Probably tonight.
 
Josh: All right. Think you guys should be all set. Oh, here's the corporate card for dinner.
Karen: Thanks.
Josh: And Karen? Let's keep it to twenty dollars a person this time.
Karen: Got it.
 
Jim: Once a quarter, the sales staff at this branch has to stay late to do order form consolidation... which, amazingly, is even less interesting than it sounds.
 
Andy: You guys ready to party?
Jim: What's that?
Andy: I said are you ready TO PARTY!
 
Phyllis: Isn't this fun? Not wearing shoes?
Angela: I wish some of us still had our shoes on.
Kevin: Stop it. It's a disease! I've told you.
 
Carol: [wearing cheerleader costume] I thought you said this was a costume party!
[points at woman] What does that look like to you?
Carol: An Indian woman in a sari.
No one's even going to notice.
Kevin: Nice outfit.
Hey, Kevin. It's a costume. Why don't you just cool it, okay? Carol? Carol.
 
I'll have one of those as well. Thank you very much. Now these are limes, lemons, onions...
Angela: I'm a vegetarian. What can I eat?
Server: It's all vegetarian.
Angela: I'll just have some bread. You used your hands.
 
Oh, yuck. [spits out food]
Carol: What? Too spicy?
No. These s'mores are disgusting.
Carol: They're not s'mores. They're samosas.
Do you think they have any s'mores?
 
All they are is chocolate, graham cracker, and marshmallow. How difficult would that have been?
 
Ryan: So, you're Kelly's sisters, huh?
Girls: [laugh] Kelly Zach Braff [speaks in Hindi]
Ryan: What?
Kelly: Ruka, Nipa, Tiffany. Stop acting like such little losers and just be cool. Come on, Ryan. Come on. Leave him alone. I hate you guys.
Ryan: They said something about Zach Braff.
Kelly: Don't even listen to them. They're so...
Ryan: No, you don't...
 
Pam: Very official.
 
Pam: I decided to come. Uh... I feel a little under-dressed... but at least I'm not dressed like a slutty cheerleader, right? Is that mean?
 
Dwight: Temp! Temp! Pflut! Pflut!
 
Kelly: I don't even want to hear it. Okay. I didn't come this Diwali to get yelled at!
Kelly's Mom: Stop it right now. Ryan is a temporary worker, makes no money. Wally is a whole doctor. So handsome.
Kelly: Uh... excuse me. I want to get a...
Kelly's Mom: He's a perfect match.
 
Andy: Hey, Big Tuna, you ready?
Jim: Yep.
Andy: One. Two. Three. Shot!
Jim: Oh, Holy Mother of God.
Andy: Oh, that burns! Golly. Um...
Jim: Good.
Karen: Ooh.
 
Overhead: [song by Beyonce Knowles] Looking so crazy, my baby. I'm not myself lately. I'm foolish. I don't do this. I've been playing myself. Baby I don't care. Cuz your love got the best of me. And baby you're making a fool of me.
 
Wow, thirty years? And you two only met once before the wedding night?
Kelly's Father: Yes.
Wow.
Kelly's Father: How long have you been married to the cheerleader?
Oh! She's not a cheerleader. She thought this was a costume party! Um... no, we're not married... yet!
Kelly's Mom: She is very fair.
She is. Very fair and very kind. So... um... tell me, is your marriage the kind of thing where when you die she has to throw herself on a fire? No? Okay. It's still very cool. Ok. Thanks!
 
Andy: One. Two. Three. Shot!
Jim: Oh.
 
Carol: Are you okay?
I'm going to be. [to DJ] Hi, I'm just going to get this for a sec... just a sec. [speaks in microphone] Um... everyone? I'm sorry, could I have your attention, please. Thank you. Ah-hah... Hi. Sorry. I just have an announcement to make. Um... okay. I have learned a lot about Indian culture tonight. But I have learned even more about love. And I know you're all thinking 'who is this crazy gringo and what is he talking about?' Well, I'm not crazy. Maybe I'm crazy in love. So without further ado, Carol? Carol Stills. I would like you to do me the honor of making me your husband.
Crowd: Awww!
Carol: Oh, Michael.
What do you say?
Carol: Can we talk about this in private?
I didn't hear you. [laughs]
Carol: [louder] Can we talk about this in private?
[lowers microphone] Oh, you've got to be kidding me. Okay.
 
No. I get it. I get it. You're not ready. We'll wait. This is a classic...
Carol: This is the ninth date, Michael.
Yeah, well, but I ... I feel like I've known you many lifetimes. Maybe I'm Hindu after all. Okay, I'm not Hindu, but... Carol. Carol, I just... I feel like... I just like you so much.
Carol: I better go. Okay, you can find a way home, all right?
Yes.
Carol: Okay.
Ok. Okay. Good night. [louder] Hey, you know what? Why don't I come with you. Cause I've got this book called the Kama Sutra.
Carol: Okay, good night, Michael.
All right. Good night.
 
Ryan: Well, I was a Temp but I got promoted. So, um... the compensation is a lot more competitive.
Kelly's Mom: So you're saving money...
Ryan: Yes.
Kelly's Mom: ...to start a family and home.
Ryan: Oh, um... or travel. And,um... and buy an Xbox.
Kelly's Father: Is there anything you wanted to ask us tonight?
 
Pam: Can you believe my boss proposed to his girlfriend in public? That is so Michael.
Young Man: Is it? He's really outgoing, huh?
Pam: Yeah. Hey, would you excuse me for a second?
 
Pam: It's hot in there. How's the naan?
Angela: Dry. You look like you were having fun.
Pam: I am. You should come dance with us.
Angela: I have to watch our shoes so they don't get stolen. Who were you texting?
Pam: No one.
 
Andy: [sings Indigo Girls] I went to the doctor. I went to the mountains. I looked to the children...
Karen: Andy, no acappella.
Andy: [sings] I looked to the children, I drank from the fountain.
Andy and Jim: [sing] There's more than one answer to these questions pointing me in a crooked line
Andy: Wait, wait.
Andy and Jim: [sing] the less I seek my source...
Karen: Oh, come on, guys. Please.
Andy and Jim: [sing] the closer I am to fi-i-i-ne. The closer I am to..
Karen: It's not good.
Andy and Jim: [sing] fi-i-i-ine!
Andy: TUNA! Are you kidding me!!
 
Oh, God! [chokes on food] Oh. Wow.
Pam: Here. [hands drink]
That's so spicy.
Pam: Yeah.
Oh. You waiting for a call?
Pam: Uh... no.
Wow. Pam. When Carol said 'No.' tonight, I think I finally realized how you must be feeling. We are both the victims of broken engagements.
Pam: Well, you were never really engaged.
I was in that marriage arena, though.
Pam: Yeah.
Yeah. Uuuuh... well.
Pam: I kind of thought something would happen tonight too.
We're so alike. So alike. [leans in to kiss her]
Pam: What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Pam: I'm rejecting your...
I'm... what? I didn't
Pam: ...kiss.
[scoffing noises] Can I have a ride home?
Pam: If you sit in the back.
 
Karen: Goodnight, guys.
Jim: Can I have a ride, man? I... uh... I have my bike.
Andy: No way, dude. I am not driving home. I have brought an inflatable bed for just such occasions. You're welcome to share it though. It's a roomy twin.
Jim: Okay.
 
Jim: Oh.
Karen: Hey dummy, get in the car!
Jim: I'm a drunk driver.
Karen: Yes, you are. Here. Let me take that. Just... uh... get in the car.
Jim: Man, you can really hold your liquor, Billabelli.
Karen: Yeah, you can't.
Jim: No kidding. And I am just going to lie down in the back, if that's all right.
Karen: Sure. Here's your bag. Just don't puke on anything. You okay?
Jim: So good.
Karen: Good.
 
These are not my shoes. This is just like that show 'Taxi Cab Confessions'.
Pam: You say one more word; I'm stopping the car.
Sorry.
 
This is going out to Indians everywhere. It's a tribute to one of the greats... Mr. Adam Sandler. [sings] Diwali is a festival of lights. Let me tell you something. Tonight has been one crazy night. So put on your saris, it's time to celebrate Diwali. Everybody looks so jolly. But it's not Christmas, it's Diwali. The goddess of destruction Kali stopped by to celebrate Diwali. Don't invite any zombies to a celebration of Diwali. Along came Polly to have some fun at Diwali. If you're Indian and you love to party, have a happy, happy, happy, happy Diwali. Happy Diwali!
Crowd: [loud clapping, cheering, and whistling]
 
 
How do I explain this to Jan?
Kelly: Um, well, basically, it's like a really big party, and everybody gets super-dressed up, and there's a bunch of different gods, and each of the gods has a special power, like the Care Bears, you know?
Oh, please, stop talking. Three words or less.
Kelly: Like, an Indian Halloween?
An Indian Halloween. Okay, great. [to phone] Pam, could you put Jan on, please?
Pam: [on phone] Michael, you're on with Jan.
Hello, Jan.
Jan: Michael, what is this about you letting everyone leave work early today?
Well, I was letting everybody go to the big Diwali party.
Jan: What is Diwali?
What is Diwali?
Jan: Yes.
You don't know what Diwali is? Wow, Jan. I'm surprised. It's the Hindu festival of lights. I just assumed you'd be familiar with it. It's the most sacred and honored Hindu holiday in the world. It's like Christmas, Easter, and Halloween---
Jan: Mich---
---rolled into one.
Jan: Oh.
I bet you're not even aware that our own Kelly Kapoor, who works in...
Kelly: Um, customer service.
... customer service is a Hindu person.
Jan: Oh.
And.
Jan: Yes, of course, I know Kelly.
Yeah.
Jan: I thought she was Muslim.
Kelly: What? I'm not Muslim!
Jan: Well, I think it sounds lovely. I think it sounds like a good idea.
You do?
Jan: Yes, of course. It's important to celebrate our company's rich diversity. And, and in fact, Michael, if you had planned better, we might have been able to charter a bus to the event---
Oh, I dunno about that.
Jan: ---or, or, or been a sponsor for the party itself.
For Kelly, that seems a bit much.
Jan: Hey, one person is an integral part of the fabric---
[hangs up]
Kelly: She's so wonderful.
Yeah, you should see her naked.
 
I had promised Carol a romantic evening on the town. Um, I wanted to take her on this spooky hay ride thing, but it was like seventy dollars a person, and she's allergic to hay. So I said, "Pop a Claritin, and I will spot you the seventy bucks," and she's like "I don't like to borrow money or take unnecessary medication." And I'm like, "Well you're really not gonna like what I slipped in your drink last night." And she's like, "What the hell are you talking about?" And I'm like, "I'm kidding. I didn't put a roof..." [cracks himself up] ... We laughed so hard... It was hilarious... oh... [calms down] So yes, I'm very excited about the Diwali party.
 
 
Kevin: For Diwali 07, you must consider Scrantonicity. For a fraction of the cost of this DJ, you could have the rocking sound stylings of a Police cover band.
Mrs. Kapoor: No Police cover.
Kevin: No, okay, well, let me send you a demo, and... Better yet, I'll give Kelly the demo, and she can give it to you. It'll save us both on postage.
Mr. Kapoor: [nods]
Kevin: Excellent.
 
 
Carol: You're the temp!
Ryan: Um, yeah. [shakes her hand] Ryan.
Carol: Hi, I'm Carol.
Ryan: Hi, nice to meet you.
Carol: The wavy brown hair and blue eyes.
Ryan: Ah.
Carol: Michael talks about you... a lot.
Ryan: Yeah.
Carol: Top of your class at business school, and you live on Shady Hill Road, right?
Ryan: Wow, um... Sorry you had to...
Dwight: Does Michael talk about me a lot?
Carol: [pause] Yes.
Dwight: He does? What does he say.
Carol: He says... "I love him." He loves you.
 
 
Andy: At Cornell, in my fraternity, my house name was "Hubble" because I was so good at finding a party. I was like a powerful space telescope, so... Freshman year, when my skin was still really bad, they called me El Guapo.
 
Andy: Yeah. Big Tuna, tuna?
Jim: Nope, I got eel.
Andy: [speechless]
Karen: [looking for Jim's sushi] Eel... eel.
Andy: Didn't see that coming.
 
 
And perhaps the most important person to Indian culture, Sir Ben Kingsley. Because of him, the British left India, and then he became an actor like Ronald Reagan.
Pam: Michael?
Yeah?
Pam: Your shirt is buttoned wrong.
So, any questions?
